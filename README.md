# Flat Array module

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Usually, this sort of functions belongs to a utility library. That's why I named the file `utls.js`... for the purpose of this exercise it can perfectly be named `index.js`.

### Instructions:
run the following command on your terminal

```sh
$ npm install
```
> Install all the dependencies


```sh
$ npm run test 
```
> Run the tests, the JS linter and generate a test coverage report


```sh
$ npm run hint 
```
> Run EsLint

### Notes:
* Error messages are stored in a javascript file to enforce consistency and make error messages reusable across the entire application.

* I'm using JSdoc for comments as a way to provide IntelliSense to other developers using this application.

* My approach when coding is readability above everything else. I've configured a very basic linter for this project.
